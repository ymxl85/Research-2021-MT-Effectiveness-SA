they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .
in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source .  
tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive .
the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . 
all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax .
the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds .
he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery .
he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature .
and personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way .
this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain .
