they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .
so what are the problems with the movie ?
well , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled .
otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . 
in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source .
the plot is deceptively simple .
one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it .
but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom .
even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does .
the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis .
