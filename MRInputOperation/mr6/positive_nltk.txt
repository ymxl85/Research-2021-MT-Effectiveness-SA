so what are the problems with the movie ?
in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source .
don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . 
the film , however , is all good .
the plot is deceptively simple .
if you like something so much , why even question it ? 
there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film .
but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom .
you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to .
but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is .
