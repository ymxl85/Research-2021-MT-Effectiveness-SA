well , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled .
do we really need to see it over and over again ?
the film , however , is all good .
george washington carver high school is having student elections . 
there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film .
but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom .
so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie .
otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie .
you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to .
but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is .
