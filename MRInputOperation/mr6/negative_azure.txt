they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . 
they get into an accident .
so what are the problems with the movie ? 
in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . 
did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ?
one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it .
the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it .
the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis .
sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course .
it couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman .
