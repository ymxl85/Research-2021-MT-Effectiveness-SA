Replication package for paper: On the Effectiveness of Testing Sentiment Analysis Systems with Metamorphic
Testing

We are building a series of python programs to automate MT, and to provide data and analysis results. 

## Evaluation:
1. The [four subject SA APIs](../main/SAtool) can be accessed automatically.
2. The python scripts for MRs: including [the input operations](../main/MRInputOperation) and [output checkers](../main/MROutputChecker) are provided.
3. The [MGs](../main/MTData/MGs) used in the evaluation and [testing results](../main/MTData/MG-outputs) of MT are presented.
4. The analysis result of FS are provided. [sr_fr.xlsx](../main/ResultAnalysis/sr_fr.xlsx) summarized VR values and FS occurrent rates of individual MRs.
